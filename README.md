## About

Many places across the web are inaccessible to those with disabilities. Poor semantics forces assistive technology users to venture into the great unknown every time they visit a site that neglects to consider their needs. These components have been constructed according to the [WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices 1.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/). Any exceptions will be listed in the corresponding component's `README`. Only vanilla JavaScript is used, and CSS styling is only applied when required to indicate the various states of a component.

## Accessibility and Improvements

Accessibility is the bedrock of a well-designed web, and every effort has been made to meet Level AAA of W3C's [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/). If you notice any bugs or have any suggestions for improvements, [create an issue](https://github.com/thejohnrt/a11y-components/issues); I'd love to hear your feedback!
